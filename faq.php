                <p>Yes, you can modify or cancel your reservation by navigating to the "My Reservations" page. Find the reservation you wish to update or cancel, and click the appropriate button. Modifications or cancellations must be made before the reservation start time.</p>

            </button>
            <div class="pannel">
                <p>If you’re late, the system holds your reserved spot for a grace period (usually 10-15 minutes). After that, your reservation may be canceled and the spot will be made available for other users.</p>

            </button>
            <div class="pannel">
                <p> The system tracks parking availability in real-time through updates provided by sensors in the parking area or by manual input from the admin. As users reserve or release spots, the system dynamically updates the status of available parking slots.</p>

            <div class="pannel">
                <p>The parking system is operational 24/7. However, some parking lots may have specific opening and closing times, which will be displayed on the platform when you attempt to book a spot.
